# Fake-News-Classifier
The main objective of doing this project was to get to know the techniques which are used for text analysis.
Build a model and then deploy it using flask.
#
During the project I got to learn about :
-tokenization
-lemmatization
-stemmation
-stop words 
-TF-IDF vectorizer
And extensive use of nltk library.
After using some basic classifers like logistics regression, I built a confusion matrix to check the accuracy.Then finally I built a pipeline.
Then I made a web app using flask to run this model on the web app.
#
PS- 1.This app can be hosted on some websites like heroku as well
    2. Accuracy of this model can be increased significantly with the use of neural networks.
